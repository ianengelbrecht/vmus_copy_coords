## VMUS Copy Coordinates

A Chrome plugin for quickly copying coordinates from a VMUS record page to the clipboard so they can be pasted to other useful places, like QGIS.

Note that only expert panel members for each VMUS project can see the original specimen coordinates. Regular users have the QDS only. 

To use this plugin in your Chrome browser, visit the [extension page on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vmus-copy-coordinates/aefnjabacdmpaoghhdbicihnpaabenmi) and install it from there.
